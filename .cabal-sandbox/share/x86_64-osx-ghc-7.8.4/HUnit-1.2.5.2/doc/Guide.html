        <h1>HUnit 1.2 User's Guide</h1>

        <p>HUnit is a unit testing framework for Haskell, inspired by the JUnit tool for Java. This
            guide describes how to use HUnit, assuming you are familiar with Haskell, though not
            necessarily with JUnit. You can obtain HUnit, including this guide, at <a
                href="http://code.haskell.org/HUnit">http://code.haskell.org/HUnit</a>.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>A test-centered methodology for software development is most effective when tests are
            easy to create, change, and execute. The <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> tool
            pioneered support for test-first development in <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>.
            HUnit is an adaptation of JUnit to Haskell, a general-purpose, purely functional
            programming language. (To learn more about Haskell, see <a href="http://www.haskell.org"
                >http://www.haskell.org</a>.)</p>

        <p>With HUnit, as with JUnit, you can easily create tests, name them, group them into
            suites, and execute them, with the framework checking the results automatically. Test
            specification in HUnit is even more concise and flexible than in JUnit, thanks to the
            nature of the Haskell language. HUnit currently includes only a text-based test
            controller, but the framework is designed for easy extension. (Would anyone care to
            write a graphical test controller for HUnit?)</p>

        <p>The next section helps you get started using HUnit in simple ways. Subsequent sections
            give details on <a href="#WritingTests">writing tests</a> and <a href="#RunningTests"
                >running tests</a>. The document concludes with a section describing HUnit's <a
                href="#ConstituentFiles">constituent files</a> and a section giving <a
                href="#References">references</a> to further information.</p>

        <h2 id="GettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>

        <p>In the Haskell module where your tests will reside, import module <tt>Test.HUnit</tt>:</p>
        <pre>
    import Test.HUnit
</pre>
        <p>Define test cases as appropriate:</p>
        <pre>
    test1 = TestCase (assertEqual "for (foo 3)," (1,2) (foo 3))
    test2 = TestCase (do (x,y) &lt;- partA 3
                         assertEqual "for the first result of partA," 5 x
                         b &lt;- partB y
                         assertBool ("(partB " ++ show y ++ ") failed") b)
</pre>
        <p>Name the test cases and group them together:</p>
        <pre>
    tests = TestList [TestLabel "test1" test1, TestLabel "test2" test2]
</pre>
        <p>Run the tests as a group. At a Haskell interpreter prompt, apply the function
                <tt>runTestTT</tt> to the collected tests. (The "<tt>TT</tt>" suggests
            <strong>T</strong>ext orientation with output to the <strong>T</strong>erminal.)</p>
        <pre>
    > runTestTT tests
    Cases: 2  Tried: 2  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
    >
</pre>
        <p>If the tests are proving their worth, you might see:</p>
        <pre>
    > runTestTT tests
    ### Failure in: 0:test1
    for (foo 3),
    expected: (1,2)
     but got: (1,3)
    Cases: 2  Tried: 2  Errors: 0  Failures: 1
    >
</pre>
        <p>Isn't that easy?</p>

        <p>You can specify tests even more succinctly using operators and overloaded functions that
            HUnit provides:</p>
        <pre>
    tests = test [ "test1" ~: "(foo 3)" ~: (1,2) ~=? (foo 3),
                   "test2" ~: do (x, y) &lt;- partA 3
                                 assertEqual "for the first result of partA," 5 x
                                 partB y @? "(partB " ++ show y ++ ") failed" ]
</pre>
        <p>Assuming the same test failures as before, you would see:</p>
        <pre>
    > runTestTT tests
    ### Failure in: 0:test1:(foo 3)
    expected: (1,2)
     but got: (1,3)
    Cases: 2  Tried: 2  Errors: 0  Failures: 1
    >
</pre>

        <h2 id="WritingTests">Writing Tests</h2>

        <p>Tests are specified compositionally. <a href="#Assertions">Assertions</a> are combined to
            make a <a href="#TestCase">test case</a>, and test cases are combined into <a
                href="#Tests">tests</a>. HUnit also provides <a href="#AdvancedFeatures">advanced
                features</a> for more convenient test specification.</p>

        <h3 id="Assertions">Assertions</h3>

        <p>The basic building block of a test is an <b>assertion</b>.</p>
        <pre>
    type Assertion = IO ()
</pre>
        <p>An assertion is an <tt>IO</tt> computation that always produces a void result. Why is an
            assertion an <tt>IO</tt> computation? So that programs with real-world side effects can
            be tested. How does an assertion assert anything if it produces no useful result? The
            answer is that an assertion can signal failure by calling <tt>assertFailure</tt>.</p>
        <pre>
    assertFailure :: String -> Assertion
    assertFailure msg = ioError (userError ("HUnit:" ++ msg))
</pre>
        <p><tt>(assertFailure msg)</tt> raises an exception. The string argument identifies the
            failure. The failure message is prefixed by "<tt>HUnit:</tt>" to mark it as an HUnit
            assertion failure message. The HUnit test framework interprets such an exception as
            indicating failure of the test whose execution raised the exception. (Note: The details
            concerning the implementation of <tt>assertFailure</tt> are subject to change and should
            not be relied upon.)</p>

        <p><tt>assertFailure</tt> can be used directly, but it is much more common to use it
            indirectly through other assertion functions that conditionally assert failure.</p>
        <pre>
    assertBool :: String -> Bool -> Assertion
    assertBool msg b = unless b (assertFailure msg)

    assertString :: String -> Assertion
    assertString s = unless (null s) (assertFailure s)

    assertEqual :: (Eq a, Show a) => String -> a -> a -> Assertion
    assertEqual preface expected actual =
      unless (actual == expected) (assertFailure msg)
     where msg = (if null preface then "" else preface ++ "\n") ++
                 "expected: " ++ show expected ++ "\n but got: " ++ show actual
</pre>
        <p>With <tt>assertBool</tt> you give the assertion condition and failure message separately.
            With <tt>assertString</tt> the two are combined. With <tt>assertEqual</tt> you provide a
            "preface", an expected value, and an actual value; the failure message shows the two
            unequal values and is prefixed by the preface. Additional ways to create assertions are
            described later under <a href="#AdvancedFeatures">Advanced Features</a>.</p>

        <p>Since assertions are <tt>IO</tt> computations, they may be combined--along with other
                <tt>IO</tt> computations--using <tt>(>>=)</tt>, <tt>(>>)</tt>, and the <tt>do</tt>
            notation. As long as its result is of type <tt>(IO ())</tt>, such a combination
            constitutes a single, collective assertion, incorporating any number of constituent
            assertions. The important features of such a collective assertion are that it fails if
            any of its constituent assertions is executed and fails, and that the first constituent
            assertion to fail terminates execution of the collective assertion. Such behavior is
            essential to specifying a test case.</p>

        <h3 id="TestCase">Test Case</h3>

        <p>A <b>test case</b> is the unit of test execution. That is, distinct test cases are
            executed independently. The failure of one is independent of the failure of any other.</p>

        <p>A test case consists of a single, possibly collective, assertion. The possibly multiple
            constituent assertions in a test case's collective assertion are <b>not</b> independent.
            Their interdependence may be crucial to specifying correct operation for a test. A test
            case may involve a series of steps, each concluding in an assertion, where each step
            must succeed in order for the test case to continue. As another example, a test may
            require some "set up" to be performed that must be undone ("torn down" in JUnit
            parlance) once the test is complete. In this case, you could use Haskell's
                <tt>IO.bracket</tt> function to achieve the desired effect.</p>

        <p>You can make a test case from an assertion by applying the <tt>TestCase</tt> constructor.
            For example, <tt>(TestCase&nbsp;(return&nbsp;()))</tt> is a test case that never
            fails, and
                <tt>(TestCase&nbsp;(assertEqual&nbsp;"for&nbsp;x,"&nbsp;3&nbsp;x))</tt>
            is a test case that checks that the value of <tt>x</tt> is 3.&nbsp; Additional ways
            to create test cases are described later under <a href="#AdvancedFeatures">Advanced
                Features</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="Tests">Tests</h3>

        <p>As soon as you have more than one test, you'll want to name them to tell them apart. As
            soon as you have more than several tests, you'll want to group them to process them more
            easily. So, naming and grouping are the two keys to managing collections of tests.</p>

        <p>In tune with the "composite" design pattern [<a href="#DesignPatterns">1</a>], a
            <b>test</b> is defined as a package of test cases. Concretely, a test is either a single
            test case, a group of tests, or either of the first two identified by a label.</p>
        <pre>
    data Test = TestCase Assertion
              | TestList [Test]
              | TestLabel String Test
</pre>
        <p>There are three important features of this definition to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <tt>TestList</tt> consists of a list of tests rather than a list of test cases.
                This means that the structure of a <tt>Test</tt> is actually a tree. Using a
                hierarchy helps organize tests just as it helps organize files in a file system.</li>
            <li>A <tt>TestLabel</tt> is attached to a test rather than to a test case. This means
                that all nodes in the test tree, not just test case (leaf) nodes, can be labeled.
                Hierarchical naming helps organize tests just as it helps organize files in a file
                system.</li>
            <li>A <tt>TestLabel</tt> is separate from both <tt>TestCase</tt> and <tt>TestList</tt>.
                This means that labeling is optional everywhere in the tree. Why is this a good
                thing? Because of the hierarchical structure of a test, each constituent test case
                is uniquely identified by its path in the tree, ignoring all labels. Sometimes a
                test case's path (or perhaps its subpath below a certain node) is a perfectly
                adequate "name" for the test case (perhaps relative to a certain node). In this
                case, creating a label for the test case is both unnecessary and inconvenient.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number of test cases that a test comprises can be computed with
            <tt>testCaseCount</tt>.</p>
        <pre>
    testCaseCount :: Test -> Int
</pre>
        <p>As mentioned above, a test is identified by its <b>path</b> in the test hierarchy.</p>
        <pre>
    data Node  = ListItem Int | Label String
      deriving (Eq, Show, Read)

    type Path = [Node]    -- Node order is from test case to root.
</pre>
        <p>Each occurrence of <tt>TestList</tt> gives rise to a <tt>ListItem</tt> and each
            occurrence of <tt>TestLabel</tt> gives rise to a <tt>Label</tt>. The <tt>ListItem</tt>s
            by themselves ensure uniqueness among test case paths, while the <tt>Label</tt>s allow
            you to add mnemonic names for individual test cases and collections of them.</p>

        <p>Note that the order of nodes in a path is reversed from what you might expect: The first
            node in the list is the one deepest in the tree. This order is a concession to
            efficiency: It allows common path prefixes to be shared.</p>

        <p>The paths of the test cases that a test comprises can be computed with
            <tt>testCasePaths</tt>. The paths are listed in the order in which the corresponding
            test cases would be executed.</p>
        <pre>
    testCasePaths :: Test -> [Path]
</pre>

        <p>The three variants of <tt>Test</tt> can be constructed simply by applying
            <tt>TestCase</tt>, <tt>TestList</tt>, and <tt>TestLabel</tt> to appropriate arguments.
            Additional ways to create tests are described later under <a href="#AdvancedFeatures"
                >Advanced Features</a>.</p>

        <p>The design of the type <tt>Test</tt> provides great conciseness, flexibility, and
            convenience in specifying tests. Moreover, the nature of Haskell significantly augments
            these qualities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combining assertions and other code to construct test cases is easy with the
                <tt>IO</tt> monad.</li>
            <li>Using overloaded functions and special operators (see below), specification of
                assertions and tests is extremely compact.</li>
            <li>Structuring a test tree by value, rather than by name as in JUnit, provides for more
                convenient, flexible, and robust test suite specification. In particular, a test
                suite can more easily be computed "on the fly" than in other test frameworks.</li>
            <li>Haskell's powerful abstraction facilities provide unmatched support for test
                refactoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="AdvancedFeatures">Advanced Features</h3>

        <p>HUnit provides additional features for specifying assertions and tests more conveniently
            and concisely. These facilities make use of Haskell type classes.</p>

        <p>The following operators can be used to construct assertions.</p>
        <pre>
    infix 1 @?, @=?, @?=

    (@?) :: (AssertionPredicable t) => t -> String -> Assertion
    pred @? msg = assertionPredicate pred >>= assertBool msg

    (@=?) :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> Assertion
    expected @=? actual = assertEqual "" expected actual

    (@?=) :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> Assertion
    actual @?= expected = assertEqual "" expected actual
</pre>
        <p>You provide a boolean condition and failure message separately to <tt>(@?)</tt>, as for
                <tt>assertBool</tt>, but in a different order. The <tt>(@=?)</tt> and <tt>(@?=)</tt>
            operators provide shorthands for <tt>assertEqual</tt> when no preface is required. They
            differ only in the order in which the expected and actual values are provided. (The
            actual value--the uncertain one--goes on the "?" side of the operator.)</p>

        <p>The <tt>(@?)</tt> operator's first argument is something from which an assertion
            predicate can be made, that is, its type must be <tt>AssertionPredicable</tt>.</p>
        <pre>
    type AssertionPredicate = IO Bool

    class AssertionPredicable t
     where assertionPredicate :: t -> AssertionPredicate

    instance AssertionPredicable Bool
     where assertionPredicate = return

    instance (AssertionPredicable t) => AssertionPredicable (IO t)
     where assertionPredicate = (>>= assertionPredicate)
</pre>
        <p>The overloaded <tt>assert</tt> function in the <tt>Assertable</tt> type class constructs
            an assertion.</p>
        <pre>
    class Assertable t
     where assert :: t -> Assertion

    instance Assertable ()
     where assert = return

    instance Assertable Bool
     where assert = assertBool ""

    instance (ListAssertable t) => Assertable [t]
     where assert = listAssert

    instance (Assertable t) => Assertable (IO t)
     where assert = (>>= assert)
</pre>
        <p>The <tt>ListAssertable</tt> class allows <tt>assert</tt> to be applied to <tt>[Char]</tt>
            (that is, <tt>String</tt>).</p>
        <pre>
    class ListAssertable t
     where listAssert :: [t] -> Assertion

    instance ListAssertable Char
     where listAssert = assertString
</pre>
        <p>With the above declarations, <tt>(assert&nbsp;())</tt>,
            <tt>(assert&nbsp;True)</tt>, and <tt>(assert&nbsp;"")</tt> (as well as
            <tt>IO</tt> forms of these values, such as <tt>(return&nbsp;())</tt>) are all
            assertions that never fail, while <tt>(assert&nbsp;False)</tt> and
                <tt>(assert&nbsp;"some&nbsp;failure&nbsp;message")</tt> (and their
                <tt>IO</tt> forms) are assertions that always fail. You may define additional
            instances for the type classes <tt>Assertable</tt>, <tt>ListAssertable</tt>, and
                <tt>AssertionPredicable</tt> if that should be useful in your application.</p>

        <p>The overloaded <tt>test</tt> function in the <tt>Testable</tt> type class constructs a
            test.</p>
        <pre>
    class Testable t
     where test :: t -> Test

    instance Testable Test
     where test = id

    instance (Assertable t) => Testable (IO t)
     where test = TestCase . assert

    instance (Testable t) => Testable [t]
     where test = TestList . map test
</pre>
        <p>The <tt>test</tt> function makes a test from either an <tt>Assertion</tt> (using
                <tt>TestCase</tt>), a list of <tt>Testable</tt> items (using <tt>TestList</tt>), or
            a <tt>Test</tt> (making no change).</p>

        <p>The following operators can be used to construct tests.</p>
        <pre>
    infix  1 ~?, ~=?, ~?=
    infixr 0 ~:

    (~?) :: (AssertionPredicable t) => t -> String -> Test
    pred ~? msg = TestCase (pred @? msg)

    (~=?) :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> Test
    expected ~=? actual = TestCase (expected @=? actual)

    (~?=) :: (Eq a, Show a) => a -> a -> Test
    actual ~?= expected = TestCase (actual @?= expected)

    (~:) :: (Testable t) => String -> t -> Test
    label ~: t = TestLabel label (test t)
</pre>
        <p><tt>(~?)</tt>, <tt>(~=?)</tt>, and <tt>(~?=)</tt> each make an assertion, as for
            <tt>(@?)</tt>, <tt>(@=?)</tt>, and <tt>(@?=)</tt>, respectively, and then a test case
            from that assertion. <tt>(~:)</tt> attaches a label to something that is
            <tt>Testable</tt>. You may define additional instances for the type class
            <tt>Testable</tt> should that be useful.</p>

        <h2 id="RunningTests">Running Tests</h2>

        <p>HUnit is structured to support multiple test controllers. The first subsection below
            describes the <a href="#TestExecution">test execution</a> characteristics common to all
            test controllers. The second subsection describes the <a href="#Text-BasedController"
                >text-based controller</a> that is included with HUnit.</p>

        <h3 id="TestExecution">Test Execution</h3>

        <p>All test controllers share a common test execution model. They differ only in how the
            results of test execution are shown.</p>

        <p>The execution of a test (a value of type <tt>Test</tt>) involves the serial execution (in
            the <tt>IO</tt> monad) of its constituent test cases. The test cases are executed in a
            depth-first, left-to-right order. During test execution, four counts of test cases are
            maintained:</p>
        <pre>
    data Counts = Counts { cases, tried, errors, failures :: Int }
      deriving (Eq, Show, Read)
</pre>
        <ul>
            <li><tt>cases</tt> is the number of test cases included in the test. This number is a
                static property of a test and remains unchanged during test execution.</li>
            <li><tt>tried</tt> is the number of test cases that have been executed so far during the
                test execution.</li>
            <li><tt>errors</tt> is the number of test cases whose execution ended with an unexpected
                exception being raised. Errors indicate problems with test cases, as opposed to the
                code under test.</li>
            <li><tt>failures</tt> is the number of test cases whose execution asserted failure.
                Failures indicate problems with the code under test.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why is there no count for test case successes? The technical reason is that the counts
            are maintained such that the number of test case successes is always equal to
                <tt>(tried&nbsp;-&nbsp;(errors&nbsp;+&nbsp;failures))</tt>. The
            psychosocial reason is that, with test-centered development and the expectation that
            test failures will be few and short-lived, attention should be focused on the failures
            rather than the successes.</p>

        <p>As test execution proceeds, three kinds of reporting event are communicated to the test
            controller. (What the controller does in response to the reporting events depends on the
            controller.)</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>start</i> -- Just prior to initiation of a test case, the path of the test case
                and the current counts (excluding the current test case) are reported.</li>
            <li><i>error</i> -- When a test case terminates with an error, the error message is
                reported, along with the test case path and current counts (including the current
                test case).</li>
            <li><i>failure</i> -- When a test case terminates with a failure, the failure message is
                reported, along with the test case path and current counts (including the current
                test case).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typically, a test controller shows <i>error</i> and <i>failure</i> reports immediately
            but uses the <i>start</i> report merely to update an indication of overall test
            execution progress.</p>

        <h3 id="Text-BasedController">Text-Based Controller</h3>

        <p>A text-based test controller is included with HUnit.</p>
        <pre>
    runTestText :: PutText st -> Test -> IO (Counts, st)
</pre>
        <p><tt>runTestText</tt> is generalized on a <i>reporting scheme</i> given as its first
            argument. During execution of the test given as its second argument, the controller
            creates a string for each reporting event and processes it according to the reporting
            scheme. When test execution is complete, the controller returns the final counts along
            with the final state for the reporting scheme.</p>

        <p>The strings for the three kinds of reporting event are as follows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <i>start</i> report is the result of the function <tt>showCounts</tt> applied to
                the counts current immediately prior to initiation of the test case being started.</li>
            <li>An <i>error</i> report is of the form
                        "<tt>Error&nbsp;in:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>path</i>\n<i>message</i></tt>",
                where <i>path</i> is the path of the test case in error, as shown by
                <tt>showPath</tt>, and <i>message</i> is a message describing the error. If the path
                is empty, the report has the form "<tt>Error:\n<i>message</i></tt>".</li>
            <li>A <i>failure</i> report is of the form
                        "<tt>Failure&nbsp;in:&nbsp;<i>path</i>\n<i>message</i></tt>", where
                    <i>path</i> is the path of the test case in error, as shown by
                <tt>showPath</tt>, and <i>message</i> is the failure message. If the path is empty,
                the report has the form "<tt>Failure:\n<i>message</i></tt>".</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The function <tt>showCounts</tt> shows a set of counts.</p>
        <pre>
    showCounts :: Counts -> String
</pre>
        <p>The form of its result is
                    "<tt>Cases:&nbsp;<i>cases</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried:&nbsp;<i>tried</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Errors:&nbsp;<i>errors</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Failures:&nbsp;<i>failures</i></tt>"
            where <i>cases</i>, <i>tried</i>, <i>errors</i>, and <i>failures</i> are the count
            values.</p>

        <p>The function <tt>showPath</tt> shows a test case path.</p>
        <pre>
    showPath :: Path -> String
</pre>
        <p>The nodes in the path are reversed (so that the path reads from the root down to the test
            case), and the representations for the nodes are joined by '<tt>:</tt>' separators. The
            representation for <tt>(ListItem <i>n</i>)</tt> is <tt>(show n)</tt>. The representation
            for <tt>(Label <i>label</i>)</tt> is normally <i>label</i>. However, if <i>label</i>
            contains a colon or if <tt>(show <i>label</i>)</tt> is different from <i>label</i>
            surrounded by quotation marks--that is, if any ambiguity could exist--then <tt>(Label
                    <i>label</i>)</tt> is represented as <tt>(show <i>label</i>)</tt>.</p>

        <p>HUnit includes two reporting schemes for the text-based test controller. You may define
            others if you wish.</p>
        <pre>
    putTextToHandle :: Handle -> Bool -> PutText Int
</pre>
        <p><tt>putTextToHandle</tt> writes error and failure reports, plus a report of the final
            counts, to the given handle. Each of these reports is terminated by a newline. In
            addition, if the given flag is <tt>True</tt>, it writes start reports to the handle as
            well. A start report, however, is not terminated by a newline. Before the next report is
            written, the start report is "erased" with an appropriate sequence of carriage return
            and space characters. Such overwriting realizes its intended effect on terminal devices.</p>
        <pre>
    putTextToShowS :: PutText ShowS
</pre>
        <p><tt>putTextToShowS</tt> ignores start reports and simply accumulates error and failure
            reports, terminating them with newlines. The accumulated reports are returned (as the
            second element of the pair returned by <tt>runTestText</tt>) as a <tt>ShowS</tt>
            function (that is, one with type <tt>(String&nbsp;->&nbsp;String)</tt>) whose
            first argument is a string to be appended to the accumulated report lines.</p>

        <p>HUnit provides a shorthand for the most common use of the text-based test controller.</p>
        <pre>
    runTestTT :: Test -> IO Counts
</pre>
        <p><tt>runTestTT</tt> invokes <tt>runTestText</tt>, specifying <tt>(putTextToHandle stderr
                True)</tt> for the reporting scheme, and returns the final counts from the test
            execution.</p>
